 * that modifying the data inside the passed {@link org.miv.antco2.NodeInfos} and

 * instances will probably cause very subtle side effects in the algorithm. These instances must be
 * considered <em>read-only</em>. All data that is extracted from them must be copied.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This behaviour has been chosen because node and edge events can be numerous, and copying
 * the node and edge information would incur a large overhead.</p>
