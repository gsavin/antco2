AntCo2 : Dynamic Load Balancing
================================================================================

AntCo2 is a dynamic load balancing algorithm, which works on a dynamic graph. It
uses ant colonies to color nodes of the graph. 

AntCo2 uses the dynamic graph library GraphStream 
( http://graphstream-project.org ) to model the graph on which the algorithm is
working.


This algorithm has been created in the PhD thesis of Antoine Dutot (
http://litis.univ-lehavre.fr/~dutot/biblio/PhdThesisDutot.pdf ).

The old version of AntCo2 is in org/miv/antco2 whereas the new version is under
org/graphstream/algorithm/antco2.
